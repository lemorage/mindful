## Acknowledgments

Mindful draws direct inspiration from [A-mem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12110), a dynamic memory system inspired by the [Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/overview). If you are interested in more details, do check out their repository [here](https://github.com/agiresearch/A-mem).

We would also like to acknowledge the following open-source projects that have greatly inspired and influenced Mindful:
- [Letta (a.k.a MemGPT)](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta)
- [mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0)
- [cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee)

A special thanks to `uv` and `pre-commit` for making my life easier when developing this project:
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- [`pre-commit`](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)

These tools and projects have been super helpful in building Mindful, and there are so many more we could mention! We are grateful for their contributions to the open-source community.
